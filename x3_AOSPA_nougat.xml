	This manifest is for AOSPA 7.1.3 for LeEco Le 1s 
	It removes the android_vendor_pa package and replace it with a modified one
	present at github.com/le1s/android_vendor_pa
	This replacement is done to include the x3 dependencies needed to build PA.

	Alternativly, you can just cherry-pick this commit:
	5a1199cf32156ad44f47747fcd8ccff149bc0d1f
	from https://github.com/Le1s/android_vendor_pa -b nougat-mr2
	and apply it on vendor/pa to include the files.

	WARNING: This doesn't work yet.
